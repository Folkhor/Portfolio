## About me üëã

Hi, my name is Andrea Melloni. After 10 years as a metalworker, I decided to pursue my passion for technology and video games by transitioning into QA Testing. I completed a QA Testing course at Digital Bros Game Academy, where I gained practical experience in identifying bugs, reporting issues, and working in team-based environments. I am particularly interested in ensuring the quality of digital experiences and making games as enjoyable and bug-free as possible.

In this portfolio, I will showcase my practical skills and knowledge in QA that I've developed through my course, self-learning, and hands-on testing. I‚Äôm also working on improving my skills in Godot, Unity and Unreal Engine as I continue to grow in this field.

## My Experience üè¢

I am currently seeking my first professional role in the gaming industry. However, I bring valuable transferable skills from my previous work as a metalworker, including attention to detail, precision, and problem-solving under tight deadlines. These skills are essential in QA, where ensuring quality and catching issues early are key. Additionally, my experience working in team environments has taught me the importance of clear communication and collaboration.

At Digital Bros Game Academy, I worked on various testing projects, focusing on bug identification and reporting across different platforms, including PC and mobile. I have also completed online courses on Jira to enhance my proficiency with the tool and prepare for real-world QA scenarios.

I am excited to continue developing my skills and knowledge in QA Testing, and I look forward to contributing to a team where quality and user experience are top priorities.
